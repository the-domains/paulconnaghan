# Recruit User Research Participants

## 1\. Design your survey 

You need to be keep in mind that people are busy. You will need to understand what the necessary incentive would be for your target users to participate. For some this may be a medium sized monetary incentive or amazon voucher. When it comes to internal users, this may be easier for you as participation itself is often enough kudos for people to want to take part. 

Now that we've covered that off, it's important to recognise that the survey is really there to help us choose the right participants. If its too easy to be selected to take part, your results will be skewed in the research as participants will 'play the survey' in order to get the the reward; rather than be selected as they fit the persona you need to test.

The survey should contain the basic demographics you'd expect such as gender, age, location, profession etc. When broadening out from these basics we are in to the territory of 'it depends'. The reason 'it depends' is because your recruitment for your product will be different to most if not all others. From the previous steps in your User Research you will know what you have built in the form of your persona's. The survey should have questions for each facet of the persona. So if you have some part of your persona template to provide insight into technology expertise, you should design a series of questions to understand the users fit. Keeping in with the technology theme, you could ask what type of phone they have;

A. iPhone

B. Android

C. Blackberry

D. Windows

E. Other mobile

F. Landline only

It is particularly useful to ensure that you always provide a broader set of answers to your ideal. In the above example if we were really trying to recruit android mobile users, the question above would work effectively to cut out the people we weren't targeting without the use of a leading question which would skew results. 

# 2\. Decide where to market your screener

Marketing your screener should be cheap. Here's a couple of pointers.
